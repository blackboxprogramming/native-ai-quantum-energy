# Ten Unsolved Problems in Mathematics

This document provides brief, high‑level descriptions of ten major open problems in
contemporary mathematics.  These problems have resisted solution despite
considerable effort and are of great theoretical importance.  They are listed
here for educational purposes.

## 1. Riemann Hypothesis

The Riemann zeta function is defined for complex numbers and encodes deep
information about the distribution of prime numbers.  Its “non‑trivial” zeros
appear to all lie on the so‑called critical line with real part one‑half.
Proving (or disproving) that all such zeros have real part exactly 1/2 is one
of the Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize problems.  A positive
resolution would have far‑reaching consequences for analytic number theory and
the error term in the Prime Number Theorem.

## 2. P vs NP Problem

In computer science, **P** denotes the class of problems that can be solved in
polynomial time, while **NP** denotes the class whose solutions can be
verified in polynomial time.  It is unknown whether these two classes are
actually equal; a proof either way would revolutionize complexity theory and
cryptography.  This is also a Millennium Prize problem.

## 3. Navier–Stokes Existence and Smoothness

The Navier–Stokes equations model the flow of incompressible fluids.  In three
dimensions, it remains open whether smooth solutions always exist for all time
given smooth initial data.  Establishing global regularity or proving finite
time blow‑up is another of the Millennium Prize problems.

## 4. Hodge Conjecture

In algebraic geometry, the Hodge conjecture predicts which cohomology classes
of smooth projective varieties over the complex numbers can be represented by
algebraic subvarieties.  Proving or disproving this statement is a
long‑standing challenge and a Millennium Prize problem.

## 5. Yang–Mills Existence and Mass Gap

Quantum Yang–Mills theory underlies the Standard Model of particle physics.  A
mathematical formulation requires proving the existence of a quantum theory and
explaining why there is a positive energy gap between the ground state and the
first excited state (the “mass gap”).  This is another Millennium Prize
problem.

## 6. Birch and Swinnerton–Dyer Conjecture

Elliptic curves are algebraic curves of great arithmetic interest.  The
conjecture formulated by Birch and Swinnerton‑Dyer relates the rank of an
elliptic curve (the size of its group of rational points) to the order of
vanishing of its L‑function at s = 1.  It remains unproven and is a
Millennium Prize problem.

## 7. Goldbach’s Conjecture

Proposed in the 18th century, Goldbach’s conjecture asserts that every
even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
Although verified computationally up to enormous bounds and supported by
heuristic arguments, a proof or disproof is unknown.

## 8. Twin Prime Conjecture

Twin primes are pairs of primes (p, p + 2).  The conjecture states that there
are infinitely many such pairs.  Despite substantial progress on bounding gaps
between primes, the conjecture remains open.

## 9. Collatz Conjecture

Starting with any positive integer n, repeatedly apply the rule n -> n/2 if n
is even and n -> 3n + 1 if n is odd.  The conjecture states that every
starting value eventually reaches the cycle 4→2→1.  No proof exists despite
its deceptively simple formulation.

## 10. Euler–Mascheroni Constant Rationality

The Euler–Mascheroni constant γ appears in analysis and number theory,
defined as the limiting difference between the harmonic series and the natural
logarithm.  It is unknown whether γ is rational or irrational; more
broadly, the nature of this constant remains mysterious.
